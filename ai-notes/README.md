# AI Usage Notes

- Used GPT-5.1-Codex-Max (Preview) for scaffolding, regex patterns, FastAPI/CLI structure, and validation logic ideas.
- Adjusted regex groups manually to avoid capturing labels; added tolerance-based money checks to reduce false mismatches.
- Added CORS middleware and better frontend error handling after manual testing.
- Future work: evaluate OCR integration suggestions; currently text-based PDFs only.
